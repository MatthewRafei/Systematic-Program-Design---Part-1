; Problem
; Design a function called area that consumes the length of one side of a square and produces the area of the square

; Remeber, when we say Design, we mean follow the recipe
; Leave behind commented out versions of the stub and template.

;; Signature : Number -> Number
;; Given length of one side of a square, produce the area


;; Stub :

(check-expect (area 3) 9) 
(check-expect (area 3.2) (* 3.2 3.2))

;(define (area s) 0)

;(define (area s)
; (... s)

(define (area s)
  (* s s))
