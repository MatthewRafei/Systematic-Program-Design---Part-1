; Problem : Design a function that consumes a number and produces twice that number. Call your function double. Follow the HtDF recipe and show the stub and template.

; Signature : Number -> Number

; Purpose : Produce 2 times the given number

; Examples : an input of 3 should produce 6
(check-expect (double 3) (* 2 3))
(check-expect (double 4.2) (* 2 4.2))

; Stub/Function def? : (define (double n) 0)

; Template
(define (double n)
  (... n))

; Code body
(define (double n)
  (* 2 n))
